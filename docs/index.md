## Welcome to Maki.
Maki is a full-stack application framework with a robust plugin ecosystem and a
convenient and extensible resource-oriented API.

### Resources
Resources are the heart and soul of Maki, which exists solely to provide a
reasonable framework for automation surrounding their definition, as they apply
to your application.

You can think of Resources just like Objects in your traditional Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) model.  With Maki, all Objects inherit from a common base
class, including a common messaging framework and event-driven state mutations.

### Services
Resources are exposed by Maki in the form of Services.  A prime example of a
Service would be the `http` service, which provides Resources to web clients in
the form of JSON or even HTML.

### Messaging
Maki's messaging infrastructure is based on JSON-RPC, a convenient wrapper for 
calling remote methods and retrieving their results.  All Maki Resources
implement the following methods:

- `ping` should be responded to with a "pong" result.
- `patch` will provide an array of operations to execute on a resource.
- `transaction` will provide an atomic set of cross-resource operations, bundling many `patch` arrays, addressed by their channel.
- `subscribe` to add an additional channel to your existing socket.
- `unsubscribe` to remove a channel from your socket.


### Default Directory Structure
Maki is meant to be understood without context or documentation, and as such the directory structure [and the code itself, for that matter] _should_ be fairly self-explanatory.  Nevertheless, here's an explicit declaration for each of the default folders and their intended use.
```bash
.
├── config          # configuration files (generally overridden by environment variables)
├── data            # data files for use in various places.
├── lib             # various classes / prototypes
├── locales         # strings for translations
├── private         # resources not exposed to the client (LESS, etc.).  This is a 1:1 map of the public folder
│   └── css         # contains the LESS files used to generate the **public** CSS files (currently, autogenerated using asset-rack)
├── public          # resources exposed to the client (images, CSS, etc)
│   ├── css         # CSS
│   ├── fonts       # Fonts (.woff, etc.)
│   ├── img         # Images
│   └── js          # JavaScript  
├── tests           # Tests.  Write them.
└── views           # composable elements for rendering HTML, JSON, or XML
```


### Architecture
Maki's architecture is Resource-centric.  All aspects of the datastore, its query pipeline, the business logic, and view layer are derived from the definition of the Resources your application exposes.
