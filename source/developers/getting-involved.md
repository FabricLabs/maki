title: "Developers: Getting Involved"

Maki is an open-source, community-driven effort.  We operate as a completely
distributed team, primarily through [Slack][slack], using [GitHub][github] for
source control.

### Getting Involved
**We need you.**  Maki has an incredible vision, and [we need
contributors][help-wanted].  Read on if you want to get involved.

#### Overview
1. [Join Slack][slack] and install the [Desktop & Mobile
clients][slack-clients].  Say hello!
2. [Browse the <span class="ui green label">help-wanted</span> label on
GitHub][help-wanted] and build a feature or fix a bug.
3. [Build something with Maki][hello-world] and [tell us about it][examples].

#### Bug Tracking & Project Planning
We track everything in [the issue tracker on GitHub][github-issues], using [a
Waffle board][waffle] to manage the status of any particular issue over time.
The [help-wanted label][help-wanted] tracks tasks that are easy to grab and take
on.

We don't follow a rigid schedule, but we post daily standups in [#standup on Slack][standups].  If you have a plan for the day, tell people about it!

We use [GitHub Milestones][milestones] to keep track of our plans and goals for
specific releases.

#### Plugins & Extensions
Maki has a [robust library of plugins][plugins], which make it easy to add a
feature to your application.  If you find value in one, consider contributing a
bugfix!
