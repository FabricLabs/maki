title: Fabric in 2016
---
Admittedly, Fabric has been a confusing amalgam of many distinct projects over
the past several years.  It has been a delicate ballet of testing many different
ideas, several significant refactors to our reference implementation, Maki, and
intense consideration and discourse with many individuals over whether or not we
take on funding, and if so – _how_.  We've had some amazing conversations and
built some really cool things, and it's time to take the next steps.

Our first priority for Q1 of 2016 is to build an active community in [the Maki
Slack][maki-slack].  As the reference library for implementations of the Fabric
protocol, we must aim to scale – which means that we must connect and inform as
many others as possible about how to build applications with Maki.

This feeds into our second priority: **making Maki the best way to build an
MVP**.  Fabric's success depends on having as many compelling applications using
the network as possible, as quickly as possible.  Early adoption of Fabric will
suffer if we do not achieve sufficient scale, so we must focus our engineering
efforts on improving Maki and making it competitive with comparable products
such as Meteor.

To do this, we will be focusing on a single Maki application, [melody][melody].
melody is a simple multi-user publishing platform, not unlike Twitter or Medium,
but self-hosted and built with Maki.  It demonstrates the most basic set of
features required to take advantage of Fabric, including content authorship,
subscriptions, and decentralized identity – which will allow us to complete the
first draft of a full-stack Maki implementation.

Our short-term needs are quite simple: **we need engineers**.  Specifically, we
are looking for client-side developers experienced with either React or Angular,
willing to help implement [our component architecture][components].

**Everyone interested in Fabric should now be in [the Maki Slack][maki-slack].**
We understand that everyone is probably already in a ton of different Slack
communities at this point, but we don't need much of your time – we've already
separated everything out into topical interests, so simply install the desktop
and mobile clients, join the channels that are of interest to you, and set your
notification preferences as desired.

Our overall sequence of events (timing aside) is as follows:

1. Slack Community Active
2. Release Maki 0.3
3. Announce Melody
4. Announce Fabric

Once we're happy with how active our Slack community is, and are satisfied with
the state of Maki as a competitive full-stack app framework, we will begin a
concerted effort to make the public aware of both Maki and Fabric.  We have
several teams lined up to handle things ranging from social media to hackathons
and meetups, but as always – resharing and broadcasting any content that comes
from [@MadeWithMaki][maki-twitter] or [@FabricProtocol][fabric-twitter] would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks for your time!  We look forward to an exciting 2016, filled with success
for each and every one of us.
