# Maki Tutorials
We like to think of Maki as a toolbox for the modern-day craftsmen of the digital world.  A master craftsman is intimately familiar with his tools, but building that relationship takes time.  We hope these tutorials will get you there faster.

## Beginners
1. [Hello World](/tutorials/hello-world) will help you build your very first app.
2. [Developer Basics](/tutorials/developer-basics) will teach you the fundamentals of software design.
3. [Initial Setup](/tutorials/initial-setup) will guide you through configuring your computer for development.
4. [Adding Resources](/tutorials/adding-resources) will teach you the basics of resource design in Maki.

## Advanced
If you're an advanced user (that is, you already are familiar with Node.js), you should check out [Maki Docs](/docs) directly.
